[Chorus]
He said he had fallen so in love with me
And I said "ditto, ditto, ditto"
He told me I'm the only one that he could see
And I said "ditto, ditto, ditto."
It's been a while my baby
I told you we could love in spite of all the things that they see
I said I wouldn't want no one if all you wanted was me
I knew back then you were the only one you're all that I need
Oh, knew that you were all that I need
Baby, now I gotta be
Part of you you're part of me
All my heart
Everything
All this time you've been waiting
[Chorus]
I've looked far to find somebody that was there for me
That sees part of me nobody else could ever see
And I said
Aww baby
I need your lovin'
All I wanted was you
You're all that I wanted
Yeah, baby, now I gotta be
Part of you, you're part of me
All my heart
Everything
All this time you've been waiting
I've thought about it oh so long
How much I need you more and more
I said baby if you want it from me
Boy you know that I will agree
[Chorus]
Ain't it so funny how real love can be simple, baby
When you find someone to share it with who feels the same
I can see it in your eyes the words you mean to say
Baby you can rest assured I, that I feel the same
[Chorus: x 2]
