Thoughts swim in black holes
A multiverse of minds I ride
Divide and multiply by none

Shared scraps of one soul
The blindfold tears into the eyes
Scream with the voices of no-one

A yawning empty space
Defective interface

Stare through the mirror of the self
Reflect the face of someone else

Force flex the engines
Courtship of chemical and chrome
Locked into unions of demand

Tissue to tendon
Congeal to seal my catacomb
Secrete the soul from rancid glands

The ocean's cold embrace
Defective interface

Stare through the mirror of the self
Reflect the face of someone else

Divide the zero down
Sunder and multiply me
Divide the zero down
